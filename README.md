# Sudoku

## Description
This is my attempt at making a sudoku solver using the concepts learnt in my Intro to AI course. It implements algorithms I learnt such as AC-3, Backchecking, and Forward Checking. It also uses the Most Contstrained Variable and Least Constraining Value heuristic for end-fast desicion-making. 

## How to run
Included is input.txt, which contains the mathematically hardest sudoku puzzle in the world.

Fork the repo into your own machine and run the script through the command line using: 'python sudoku.py input.txt output.txt'

The answer will be output into output.txt which will be created. Take care not to run this script in an existing folder with an 'output.txt' inside as it will overwrite it.

# Have fun!
